                    <p>Although the battle is still waging against the bots. The community have thought of plans and solutions on how to try and get Valve's attention to fix their game. One plan they've successfully carried out is by bombing the game with negative reviews in order to get game articles to talk about it, and they encouraged players to stop buying virtual items in order to to further bring their attention.</p>
                    <p>There are many more solutions that the community have come up with, and this page will list the solution for Team Fortress 2, starting with:</p>
                    <p style="font-size:180%;">1. INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF UPDATES.</p>Encourage more frequent updates that include significant content improvements, such as more game types, maps, and cosmetics.
                    <p style="font-size:180%;">2. GOOD BALANCE PATCHES.</p>In order to solve overpowered or underpowered classes and weapons, implement more frequent and focused balancing updates.
                    <p style="font-size:180%;">3. BETTER ANTI-CHEAT MEASURES.</p>To better identify and discourage cheating, strengthen the anti-cheat system and impose harsher punishments on violators.
                    <p style="font-size:180%;">4. OPEN COMMUNICATION WITH THE DEVS.</p>Create more regular and transparent lines of communication, including frequent developer updates and interactions, between Valve and the TF2 community.
                    <p style="font-size:180%;">5. TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS.</p>To improve the overall gameplay experience, prioritize streamlining game performance, bolstering server stability, and resolving connectivity problems.
                    <p style="font-size:180%;">6. AND SO MUCH MORE.</p>Just like problems.html, there are a lot. Like a lot of solutions and plans that the community has made, but only a few plans have worked so far. We'll see how things go in the future!
