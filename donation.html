                    <p>Valve has implemented a number of significant changes as of July 1st to address the botting issue in Team Fortress 2. Although the community is very appreciative of the steps being taken, the community feels that more proof is needed to justify the increased trust in the game's future.</p>Maintaining these efforts is essential if we don't want to risk returning to a bot-infested status quo. Customers of Team Fortress 2 should be strongly advised to modify their spending patterns and/or evaluate ratings in light of the potential continuation of these anti-bot tactics as the Summer Update approaches.
                    <p style="font-size:180%;">SHOULD BOTS STILL BE ABSENT BY THE SUMMER UPDATE:</p>This is fantastic news! But it is also important to remember that at times of high player excitement, bad actors are more motivated to host bots. It is strongly advised to hold off on making any in-game or Steam market purchases until you have much more evidence that bot accounts are being dealt with promptly and consistently. A few instances are account deletion, community bans, and game bans.
                    <p style="font-size:180%;">IF THE SUMMER UPDATE ARRIVES BEFORE OR AFTER THE BOTS RETURN:</p>It is advised to withhold any financial investments with TF2 until the problem has been rectified. Before gamers start making more money to support Team Fortress 2, it should be playable.
